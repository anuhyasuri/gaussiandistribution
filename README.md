# Gaussian Distribution

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook explores the concept of Gaussian Distribution. It covers topics such as Gaussian distribution, Multivariate Gaussian distribution and Isotropic Gaussian distribution. The notebook also includes practical implementation using Python, like generating random data that follows these distributions and visualizing them through various plots.
